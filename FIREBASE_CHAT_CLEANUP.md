# MoccetChat.firebase.jsx Cleanup Summary

## Fixed Compilation Errors

### 1. Updated Imports
- Removed: `import TestPanel from './components/TestPanel';`
- Removed: `import MessageDebugPanel from './components/MessageDebugPanel';`
- Added: `import UnifiedDebugPanel from './components/UnifiedDebugPanel';`

### 2. Replaced Debug Components
- Removed `<TestPanel>` component usage
- Removed `<MessageDebugPanel>` component usage
- Removed custom inline debug panel (the one showing debug info)
- Removed "Simplified control panel" with Create Workspace and Start Fresh buttons
- Added single `<UnifiedDebugPanel>` component

### 3. Result
- All compilation errors resolved
- Cleaner UI with single debug button (üõ†Ô∏è) in bottom-left corner
- All debug functionality consolidated into the unified panel
- Both MoccetChat.jsx and MoccetChat.firebase.jsx now use the same debug interface

## Benefits
- Consistent debug experience across both chat implementations
- No more duplicate debug panels
- Cleaner codebase with less maintenance overhead
