# Profile Menu Implementation

## Changes Made

### 1. Profile Menu Dropdown
- **Trigger**: Clicking on the profile picture in the sidebar now opens a dropdown menu instead of directly logging out
- **Menu Items**:
  - **Profile**: Opens a modal with user information
  - **Log Out**: Logs the user out (with a divider line above it for separation)
- **Click Outside**: Menu closes when clicking anywhere else on the page

### 2. Profile Modal
Shows comprehensive user information:
- **Avatar**: Large profile picture (or placeholder icon)
- **Display Name**: User's display name (if set)
- **Email**: User's email address
- **User ID**: Firebase UID
- **Email Verified**: Shows verification status with green checkmark or red X
- **Account Created**: Date when the account was created
- **Last Sign In**: Date of the most recent sign in

### 3. Visual Design
- **Dropdown Menu**:
  - Clean white background (dark gray in dark theme)
  - Smooth hover effects
  - Icons for each menu item
  - Red color for the logout option
  - Positioned above the avatar with proper spacing

- **Profile Modal**:
  - Centered modal with backdrop
  - Large avatar at the top
  - Organized information fields with labels
  - Consistent styling with the rest of the app
  - Responsive design

### 4. Implementation Details
- Added state for `showProfileMenu` and `showProfileModal`
- Click handler on avatar toggles the menu
- Click outside listener closes the menu
- Profile data pulled from Firebase Auth (`currentUser`) and user profile
- CSS classes added for styling all new components
- Dark theme support included

## User Experience Flow

1. **Click Avatar** → Profile menu appears
2. **Click "Profile"** → Profile modal opens with user information
3. **Click "Log Out"** → User is logged out
4. **Click Outside** → Menu closes automatically

## Benefits
